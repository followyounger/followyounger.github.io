    你好，我是 Soptq ,目前是一名 2018 级 CS 专业的学生，欢迎来到我的博客。
    <br><br>
    我从小就对计算机拥有非常浓厚的兴趣。从小学5年级的机器人图形化编程，6年级的 Pascal 入门，初中三年的 NOIP 竞赛，最后再到高中的自学 Java，Android 程序设计，以及对树莓派的自定义编程。我荣幸的在高考中考入了{% include extensions/spoiler.html content='四川大学' %}，并进入了计算机专业珠峰计划班。我似乎这么多年来始终与计算机有不解之缘。
    <br><br>
    学习过多种语言后，我发现其实各种语言的实质是相似的，真正可以区分在这个专业上的厉害程度的，是实战，是对算法的理解。几年来，我刷了 LeetCode，因为应用程序的开发自学了 mySQL 数据库，为 Github 社区贡献过自己的力量，也从其拿走了一些前辈的经验。全英文的公开课，文献早在高二就已经不成问题。从中我习得了很多经验，也获得了很多真正的快乐，这是在初高中的课堂上很难体会到的。有人说我不自量力，因为我并不知道他们的全部原理，但我认为只有提前享受了工具带给我的快乐，才可以在日后的学习中保持兴趣之心。也正是这样的兴趣才让我在计算机科学这条道路上走到今天。
    <br><br>    
    我从小就对自己的定位和对未来的规划非常明确，我一直知道自己想做什么，要做什么。初中的时候，我便已经有能力独立思考，并明确了我未来的人生轨迹。我热爱计算机编程，所以我一直沿着这条初中时期的人生轨迹行走至今，毫不后悔。

        Hi, my name is Soptq. Cuttently i am a student learning CS. Welcome to my blog.
    <br><br>
    I was attracted by Computer Science when i was very young. It begins with the GUI-coding for robots when i was in primary school, NOIP when i was in middle school,  learning Java & Android Studio, coding for PI when i was in high school. I was very honored to have a good grade during CEE and get into a very great university: {% include extensions/spoiler.html content='SiChuan University' %}, and get into the top class of Computer Science Subject. It seems like i always have a “weird” relationship with CS.
    <br><br>
    After learning multiple languages, I found that all languages are actually the same, the real difference between Bill Gates and me is the understanding of coding, the understanding of algorithms. These years i had done LeetCode, i had learned mySQL because of the developing of my Android Application, i also had contributed something to Github community. The classes and documents that in English are even not a problem for me. I gained experience from them, and happiness as well. Some said i do something that beyond my ability, but i believe only benefit from tools first, can we contain the interests when I learn the basic of them.
    <br><br>
    I always have a very clear images of myself and know exactly what i want to do in the future. i know what i want to do, and what i need to do as well. when i was in middle school, i had already known what is my life goals, and sticked to it until now.
    <br><br>
    <h4># University</h4>
    <br><br>
    Middle schools and high schools are fostering students that can do everything, but i think society needs people can do one thing very well.  Learning everything in university is a waste of life! I love CS, so i give up my physics; I love English, so i give up my Chinese. life is getting stronger along the road of giving up. I will contribute my limited life time to my future.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The future that you will think The place that you will go</strong>
    <br><br>
    If you ask me about the meaning of university, i can say and only say to make myself stronger. i was wondering the life in university since i was in middle school, because university for me, is a symbol of freedom, not the freedom for body, but for mind.I will not waste my wonders. As i said, i know what i want to do —— since middle school.
