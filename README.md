Soptlog is a static website that powered by jekyll and hosted by Github Pages. Soptlog is derived but different from [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io). A lot of features and new technologies are applied to Soptlog which make it maybe the best jekyll personal website in the world.


## How To Use It

Currently this blog is implementing best practices, many features are not configurable and may change in the near future. A full documentation will be released when everything is settle down.

However there is a WIP guide you can read now: [README-WIP](README-WIP.md)

You are always welcomed to ask me details by reporting issues before the full documentation releases.
